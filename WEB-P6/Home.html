						<p class="fonts2"> Energy drinks have the effects that caffeine and sugar provide, but experts still argue about the possible effects
						 of the other ingredients.[18] Most of the effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction 
						speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine.[32] There is evidence that energy drinks can increase mental[33][34][35] and 
						athletic[36][37] performance. Performance during prolonged driving is increased after consumption of Red Bull.[35] Other tests for 
						physical performance showed results such as increased endurance and power. Red Bull energy drink increased upper body muscle endurance 
						during repeated Wingate tests in young healthy adults.[38] Excessive or repeated consumption of energy drinks can lead to cardiac and 
						psychiatric conditions.[15][16]
						<br>
						The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that exposure to taurine and glucuronolactone at the levels presently used in energy 
						drinks is not a safety concern.[39] In a separate analysis, they also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a number 
						of commercial health claims about taurine.[40] A review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health 
						effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, including Red Bull. The review also states that though the caffeine 
						and sugar levels in the energy drink are comparable to those present in coffee and fruit juice respectively, these levels have been shown 
						to cause adverse health effects.[41] </td>
